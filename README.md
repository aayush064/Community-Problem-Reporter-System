# Community Problem Reporter System

A web-based civic reporting platform that allows citizens to report local community problems and view issues based on geographic location (province, district, municipality, ward).

---

## 🚀 Elevator Pitch

A simple and location-based civic reporting system that helps communities report, track, and resolve local problems efficiently.

---

## 📌 About the Project

The **Community Problem Reporter System** was inspired by the need for a simple digital platform where citizens can report problems in their local areas such as damaged roads, garbage issues, water supply problems, or broken street lights.

In many places, local problems go unreported or unresolved due to lack of a centralized reporting mechanism. This project aims to bridge that gap by providing an easy-to-use system that organizes issues based on location and helps authorities or administrators track and resolve them.

## ✨ What it Does

- Allows users to **report community problems**
- Uses **location-based selection** (Province → District → Municipality → Ward)
- Displays problems **only after selecting a location**
- Filters problems by **province, district, municipality, and ward**
- Supports **image uploads** for better issue description
- Provides an **admin panel** to update problem status (Pending / Solved)
- Ensures clean UI and structured data storage

## 🛠 How We Built It

- Frontend built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- Dynamic location selection using **JavaScript and JSON**
- Backend developed using **PHP**
- Data stored and managed with **MySQL**
- Used **prepared statements** for secure database queries
- Location-based filtering implemented using **GET requests**
- Project tested locally using **XAMPP**

## ⚠️ Challenges We Ran Into

- Designing a **multi-level location filtering system**
- Managing large location data efficiently
- Ensuring database queries worked for partial selections (e.g., province-only)
- Debugging SQL errors related to missing columns
- Maintaining consistent UI across different pages

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- Successfully implemented **hierarchical location filtering**
- Built a realistic civic-tech system with real-world use case
- Created a clean and structured database design
- Implemented secure backend logic using prepared statements
- Designed a project suitable for **real community use**
